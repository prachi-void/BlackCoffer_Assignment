# NLP Text Analysis from Web URLs

This Python script extracts textual content from a list of URLs, performs Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, and calculates various linguistic metrics.

## Features:
- **Data Extraction:** Extracts text content from URLs using web scraping techniques.
- **Text Processing:** Cleans and processes the extracted text data for analysis.
- **Linguistic Metrics:** Calculates linguistic metrics including positive score, negative score, polarity score, subjectivity score, etc.

## Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: pandas, requests, BeautifulSoup, numpy, nltk, string, matplotlib, seaborn

## Instructions:
1. Install the required libraries using pip:
-pip install pandas requests beautifulsoup4 numpy nltk matplotlib seaborn

2. Download NLTK resources by running the following command in Python:
```python
import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')

Prepare your input data in an Excel file ('Input.xlsx') with columns 'URL_ID' and 'URL'.
Run the script 'nlp_text_analysis.py'. The script will perform data extraction, NLP tasks, and generate output scores.
The script will create an output CSV file ('output_scores.csv') containing the computed linguistic metrics for each URL.

##Note:
Ensure that the input Excel file ('Input.xlsx') is correctly formatted with valid URLs.
Handle exceptions gracefully for any failed URL retrievals during the extraction process.
